🛡️ PyUninstallX-Project v2 — Next-Gen Virus Detection & Performance Upgrade

PyUninstallX-Project v2 marks a decisive step forward in the evolution of the tool, delivering a much more powerful and intelligent virus-detection engine. This version introduces deep optimizations that make threat scanning ⚡ 32% faster than v1, allowing the system to analyze files, processes, and registry entries with noticeably greater speed and precision. The new detection core has been fine-tuned to identify suspicious patterns more accurately, reduce false positives, and respond more effectively to real threats.

Behind the scenes, the scanning architecture has been rebuilt to handle large directories, nested structures, and real-time monitoring with improved stability. Users will feel the difference immediately: faster scan times, smoother background execution, and a more responsive interface during heavy tasks. Whether you're cleaning up stubborn malware, tracking unusual process behavior, or using PyUninstallX as a general system guardian, v2 delivers a stronger, more reliable experience across the board.

This release reflects a continuing commitment to building a security-focused tool that stays ahead of modern threats and provides users with a smarter, sharper, and more secure environment.
